# Privacy Policy (SmallBatch)

SmallBatch stores all operational data (products, ingredients, recipes, sales, expenses) locally in your browser via LocalStorage. Data never leaves your device unless you enable GitHub Gist backups or manually export it.

## Data Stored
- Products (name, costs, price)
- Ingredients (unit, cost per unit)
- Recipes (ingredient → quantity)
- Sales (date, product, quantity, unit price, discount, notes)
- Expenses (date, category, amount, notes)
- Meta timestamps

## Export / Encryption
Plain JSON & encrypted JSON exports are user‑initiated.

## Removal
Use "Reset All Data" (per signed-in user) or clear site storage in browser settings.

## Third Parties
- Google Identity Services (only for sign-in & ID token).
- GitHub API (only if you configure gist backups).

No analytics, no ads.

## Changes
Updates to privacy will appear here. Continue use implies acceptance.
