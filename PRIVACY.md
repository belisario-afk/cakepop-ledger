# Privacy Policy

SmallBatch stores all data locally in your browser. Data only leaves if you:
1. Export (plain or encrypted)
2. Configure GitHub Gist backup

No analytics, ads, or hidden tracking.

## Stored Data
Products, Ingredients, Recipes, Sales, Expenses, Theme/Settings, timestamps.

## Removal
Use "Reset All Data" (per user) or clear site storage via browser.

## Encryption
AES-GCM with PBKDF2 derived key (password unknown to the app). Losing password = irrecoverable export.

## Third Parties
- Google Identity (if sign-in used)
- GitHub API (if gist backup used)

## Changes
Updates to privacy will appear here.
